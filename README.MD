# Fantasy Inventory Shop

A fantasy inventory management app that I built to learn the MVC design pattern, along with CRUD operations with MongoDB, Express.JS, and Mongoose for ORM.

You can see it in action, add items to the store, create categories, at https://fantasy-inventory-app.herokuapp.com/! Please note, it will load slowly at first since it is hosted on Heroku's free service.
