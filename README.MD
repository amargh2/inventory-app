# Fantasy Inventory App

An inventory management app that I built to learn the MVC design pattern, along with CRUD operations with MongoDB, Express.JS, and Mongoose for ORM. I built this when I was first learning Express and recently came back and added a product grid and
local authentication for deleting and editing items. I also changed the hosting platform.
